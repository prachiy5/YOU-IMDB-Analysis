> "You're not just someone. You're *the* someone. The reason my story begins... again."

## Inside Joe’s Mind

Welcome. If you're here, you’re probably curious. Curious about *me*, Joe Goldberg. Or maybe it’s the bodies... of work. Either way, I built this dashboard for *you*. Yes, you.

This isn't just about ratings. It's about *patterns*. Emotions. Obsessions. Every episode. Every season. Every *love*. It's all here. Visualized. Tracked. Understood.

## The Purpose

I needed a way to see it all — the highs, the lows, the twisted turns — from **Season 1 to Season 4** of *YOU*. So I put together this dashboard to:

- Show **IMDb ratings** of every episode, across all seasons.
- Highlight the *emotional temperature* of each season using color-coded ratings.
- Track my... connections. The ones who mattered. The ones I *loved*. 
  - Beck.
  - Love.
  - Marienne.
  - Kate.
- And yes, there’s a spot for the next one. There’s always a next one. Isn’t there?

## What You’ll Find

### Episode Ratings (Right Side)
Each row is an episode. Each column is a season. Each number — an IMDb rating, color-coded:
- Green: High praise. People loved it.
- Orange: Lukewarm. Not bad, not great.
- Red: Meh. Something went wrong.

From the breakout beginnings of Season 1 to the split-personality spiral of Season 4, it’s all there.

### Love Interests Timeline (Left Side)
This part is more... personal. It’s a timeline of the women who’ve captured my heart (and occasionally... didn’t make it out alive).

- **Guinevere Beck** — She was the first. Sweet, poetic. Gone too soon.
- **Love Quinn** — She understood me. Until she didn’t.
- **Marienne Bellamy** — Graceful, smart. She ran, and maybe... that was best.
- **Kate Galvin** — She’s still here. For now.

There's also a question waiting:  
**Who’s next?**  
No spoilers. Let life (or death) unfold.

## Time Frame

The story spans from **2018 to 2023**, across **4 seasons** and **40 episodes**, with an average IMDb rating of **7.83**. Not bad, right? You can’t please everyone... but I try.

## Why It Matters

This dashboard is more than data. It’s a reflection of *patterns*, *obsession*, and *consequences*. Whether you’re a fan of analytics, true crime, or *me* — this is for you.

So take a look. Explore. Click around.

But remember... I’m watching *you*, too.

Joe.
